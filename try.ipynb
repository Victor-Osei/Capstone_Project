    "The sales pattern is dominated by low-cost, frequently purchased items, with most customers buying small quantities per transaction.\n",
    "Premium products have lower sales volumes, indicating that customers are more price-sensitive and tend to purchase lower-priced items more frequently.\n",
    "Understanding this customer behavior can help in targeting promotions and inventory planning, focusing on high-turnover products while strategically positioning higher-priced items."

    "Based on the box plots provided for \"Price Each\" and \"Quantity Ordered,\" here are some key insights and observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Price Each (Image 1):\n",
    "   - The median price (represented by the line in the box) is relatively low, likely around $50-100.\n",
    "   - There's a wide range of prices, with the box (representing the interquartile range) extending to about $200.\n",
    "   - There are many outliers above the upper whisker, indicated by individual points.\n",
    "   - Some extreme outliers exist at prices around $750, $1000, and $1750.\n",
    "   - The distribution is heavily right-skewed, with most items priced low but a few very expensive items.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Quantity Ordered (Image 2):\n",
    "   - The median quantity ordered is 1, as shown by the single line at the bottom of the plot.\n",
    "   - The box is compressed into this line, indicating that at least 75% of orders are for a single item.\n",
    "   - There are multiple outliers, with some orders reaching quantities of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and even 9 items.\n",
    "   - The distribution is extremely right-skewed, with most orders being for single items but occasional bulk orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations and meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Product Range: The company likely sells a wide range of products, from inexpensive accessories to high-end electronics or appliances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pricing Strategy: The presence of many low-priced items with a few very high-priced outliers suggests a strategy of offering a mix of affordable products and premium options.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Buying Behavior: Customers typically purchase one item at a time, which could indicate:\n",
    "   - Products are often bought individually rather than in sets.\n",
    "   - Each product might fulfill a specific need, not requiring multiple purchases.\n",
    "   - High-value items are less likely to be bought in bulk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inventory Management: The business should be prepared to stock more of the lower-priced items and fewer of the expensive ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Sales Analysis: When analyzing sales data, it's crucial to consider these outliers, as high-priced items sold in small quantities might significantly impact total revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Marketing Implications: The company might want to focus on upselling or cross-selling strategies to increase the quantity ordered, especially for lower-priced items.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Customer Segmentation: There might be different customer segments - those who buy single, low-priced items, and those who occasionally make large or expensive purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Data Quality: It's worth verifying if the extreme outliers in both price and quantity are accurate or if they represent data entry errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights can be valuable for pricing strategies, inventory management, marketing campaigns, and overall business strategy. The presence of outliers in both price and quantity suggests a diverse product range and customer base, which the company can leverage for targeted strategies."
